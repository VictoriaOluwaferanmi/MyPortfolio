          I enrolled in Stutern for the front-end track in the year 2022. Where
          I learned the fundamentals up to an advanced level of software
          engineering. In the process of learning, I was not only skilled with
          recent front-end technologies but also with human skills. During this
          period, aside from working on some personal projects, I worked with a
          team of developers and designers to develop a project (Handout), an
          eCommerce website. I participated in the project development processes
          including defining, designing/prototyping, development, Testing,
          Implementation, Integration, and deployment. I worked on building the
          designs (prototype), their responsiveness, functionalities,
          integration, deployment, and aswel documentation.

            In 2021, I participated in the SheCodeAfrica 3-months UI/UX mentee
            program, where I got experience in user research, wireframing, UI/UX
            design principles, and using design tools. These have been
            applicable in my front-end journey.

            I have a national diploma in computer science and I am pursuing a
            degree in computer science which contributed to my background in
            computer fundamentals, programming, System design and some other
            computer science-related courses. As much as I am passionate about
            building user interfaces, I enjoy learning new things and networking
            with people of related interests.

          <p className="py-5">
            I am working on improving my technical skills and social skills. I
            am open to internship programs, job opportunities, open-source
            projects, neworking and other software developer opportunities.
